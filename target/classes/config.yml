# Below are the chat settings.

chat:
  lock:
    # If you want chat to be locked, change this to "true"
    enabled: false
    # This can also be run in game by doing:
    # /mt chat lock
    # You must have the modtools.chat.lock permission to
    # perform this command. You can also grant the
    # modtools.chat.lock.exempt permission to a group you
    # want to be exempt from the lock.
  slow:
    # If you want the chat to be on slow mode, change the 0
    # after length below to the amount of seconds a user must
    # wait before sending another message. You must also
    # change the enabled section to "true"
    length: 0
    enabled: false
    # Like above, this can be changed in game by
    # running the command:
    # /mt chat slow <length>
    # You must have the modtools.chat.slow permission to
    # perform this command. You can also grant the
    # modtools.chat.slow.exempt permission to a group you
    # want to be exempt from the lock.
